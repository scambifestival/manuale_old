# 🌲 Pino

Pino is the database containing all of the data concerning all of Scambi. It is still being  heavily developed, therefore its working details are not definitely defined.

### What

Pino mostly collects data about people and what they do in relation to Scambi. Rather than explaining what it does, it is much easier to open it and see it by yourself.

### How

Pino is handled through a software named [Baserow](../piattaforme-e-strumenti/baserow.md), and everything you need to know about it is thorougly explained [here](../piattaforme-e-strumenti/baserow.md).
